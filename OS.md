## Extras:
*  When booted, the computer has a set of intructions in the ROM called the BIOS. The BIOS instructs the CPU to load the OS into the RAM first. BIOS stands for __basic input/output system__.
*  ROM stands for __read only memory__. It is not volatile unlike the __Random Access Memory__. It is permanent and the instructions stay even after the computer is switched off. 
*  After the BIOS loads in it starts to control the input and output devices while the OS is loaded in from the secondary storage.
*  The BIOS instructions are copied from the ROM onto the main memory (RAM). After this it runs on the CPU
*  The operating system is typically stored in the hard disk of the computer since it isnt removable, it is a more reliable location
