# Need for both high level and low level languages:
*  Low level languages are used to communicate directly with the computer since their commands are very close to the CPU 's actual instruction set
*  High level languages make it easier to write a program than low level languages. The high level language is translated into machine code by a compiler and run
*  A high level language can also run on an interpreter
# Need of compilers for high level languages:
*  A compiler translates the entire program to machine code and saves it as a file
*  input to compiler is the program written in high level language
*  Output of compiler is an executable file (.exe file extension)
*  machine code (compiled code) tend to execute faster than interpreted code
# Use of interpreters:
*  interpreters translate the program code and execute while translating.
*  translates enough to carry out an instruction and it carries out the instruction
*  Languages translated by interpreters are called interpretted language
*  (python is an interpretted language )
# compilers VS interpreters
*  compilers have relatively faster execution time
*  easy to debug with interpreters as it scans line by line until the error is met
*  Compiler makes an executable file that can be given to another person/sold. Interpreter language can only run if there is an interpreter
*  Easy to make small changes in program with interpreter. You have to re compile the code with compiler
# Assemblers:
*  Used to convert assembly codes to machine code
*  input is assembly program
*  output is executable file
*  one line of assembly code turns into one instruction in machine code because of the similarity of the assembly codes and binary numbers used by machine code
